## Problem Statement

**TriNetraa** is a contactless heart-rate monitoring system designed to analyze micro-movements in the red and green channels of video footage. It utilizes advanced computer vision and AI techniques to detect systolic and diastolic signals with reliability, even at low frame rates. 

The project addresses the limitations of traditional monitoring methods by providing a cost-effective, scalable, and non-invasive solution suitable for both remote and clinical environments.
