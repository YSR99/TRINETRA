## **Problem Statement**

**TriNetraa** is a **contactless heart-rate monitoring system** designed to analyze **micro-movements in the red and green channels** of video footage. It utilizes **advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques** to detect **systolic and diastolic signals** with high reliability, even at **low frame rates**.

This project addresses key limitations of traditional heart-rate monitoring methods by offering a:
- **Cost-effective**
- **Scalable**
- **Non-invasive**

solution suitable for both **remote healthcare settings** and **clinical environments**.
